***Problem Statement***<br>
Technology has been beneficial to most users but not all user segments have been tapping into the
potential of technology. One such application is disease prediction among crops/plants. While most
farmers across the country have access to smartphones, the majority of them have not understood
the perks of having technologies such as Machine Learning and IoT at their disposal.
So, the problem here is focussed on helping farmers identify diseases among crops at the tip of their
fingers via their phones. This in turn affects the Supply vs Demand chart as well.

***Motivation and Objectives***<br>
The model we use must be trained using images from the training dataset to accurately classify a
given image from the testing dataset into different diseased categories or as a healthy leaf, it must
also accurately distinguish between many diseases and sometimes more than one disease may be
present on a single leaf. It must deal with rare classes and novel symptoms; Address depth
perceptionâ€”angle, light, shade, physiological age of the leaf; and Incorporate expert knowledge in
identification, annotation, quantification, and guiding computer vision to search for relevant
features during learning. The results obtained via the Machine Learning model are showcased in the
form of a web application and an android application.

***Project Applications***<br>
This project not only applies to the farmers but also can be seen helpful to anyone trying to grow a
plant/crop. To identify diseases beforehand is super essential so that preventive measures can be
taken to ensure a healthy growth of the crop/plant.

***Introduction***<br>
Misdiagnosis of the many diseases impacting agricultural crops can lead to misuse of chemicals
leading to the emergence of resistant pathogen strains, increased input costs, and more outbreaks
with significant economic loss and environmental impacts. Current disease diagnosis based on
human scouting is time-consuming and expensive, and although computer-vision based models
have the promise to increase efficiency, the great variance in symptoms due to age of infected
tissues, genetic variations, and light conditions within trees decreases the accuracy of detection.

SwayaKT is an android application aimed at assisting farmers in providing timely care to plants to
ensure that plants do not get spoiled. This in turn ensures there is a balance on the Supply vs
Growth chart. The application provides a platform for users to identify the different diseases among
Tomato and Potato plants.<br>
The identification happens with the help of a machine learning model which identifies if a plant has
a particular disease or not. If there exists a disease, then the user can view information about the
disease and ways to prevent the same among other kinds of information too.
